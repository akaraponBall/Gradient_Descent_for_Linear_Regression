# Gradient Descent for Linear Regression: A NumPy and Matplotlib Implementation

This repository showcases a foundational implementation of gradient descent for linear regression, built entirely from scratch using NumPy and Matplotlib. The project serves as an educational tool to understand the core principles of optimization and regression, without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The linear regression model predicts a target variable (y) from an input feature (x) using the equation:
$$y = mx + c $$

## Objective
- Demonstrate the process of optimizing model parameters using gradient descent.
- Offer a step-by-step approach to implementing regression models without external libraries.
- Provide a clear visualization of how optimization works in linear regression.

## Contributions
Feel free to explore, run the code, and modify it to deepen your understanding of gradient descent and linear regression! Contributions and suggestions are always welcome.
